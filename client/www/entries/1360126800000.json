The problem I have with it is the difficulty of getting ImageMagick to work with a project I’ve started to play with in ruby on rails. HomeBrew, while not making ImageMagick any easier to deal with, does have some very nice features. The best I’ve found so far is the version control system built in Git (Ports may very well have had this, and I never stumbled across it). With Mac HomeBrew, you can look at all the versions stored in a Git repository using the command “brew versions “. Using this command, I was able to check out the version of ImageMagick I was hoping to try with the following commands:"
